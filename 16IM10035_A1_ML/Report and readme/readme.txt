The first code i.e Ans1 can be run by opening it into any of the text editor which supports python 3.7.

The second code i.e for Ans 2 and 3 consists of the functions used by me in order to generate the curves and the learning curve for different sizes of dataset as well as for for different orders of the dataset. You can run the by changing the respective function arguments. Running it straight away should generate the curves for one such size and order.
